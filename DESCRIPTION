Description: Provides color palettes designed to be reminiscent of text on paper.
    The color schemes were taken from <https://stephango.com/flexoki>.
    Includes discrete, continuous, and binned scales that are not necessarily 
    color-blind friendly. Simple scale and theme functions are available for use 
    with 'ggplot2'.
